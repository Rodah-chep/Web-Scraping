# Web Scraping Portfolio

Welcome to **Web-Scraping**, a comprehensive showcase of my skills in web scraping, data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model development, and deployment. This repository demonstrates end-to-end projects that extract valuable insights from raw web data and deliver actionable solutions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repo is designed to highlight my proficiency in:

- **Web Scraping:** Automated collection of web data using modern libraries and robust scraping methodologies.
- **Data Analysis & EDA:** Cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and deriving insights from complex datasets.
- **Model Development:** Building and optimizing machine learning models—regression, classification, NLP, and more.
- **Deployment:** Packaging models and solutions for production using APIs or web apps (e.g., Flask/FastAPI or Streamlit).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main language for data scraping, analysis, and model building
- **Libraries:** BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment:** Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker (for containerization)
- **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping, Git for version control

## 📚 Example Projects

1. **Scraping e-commerce websites:** Automating price monitoring and product data extraction.
2. **Gathering public social media data:** Sentiment analysis and user behavior modeling.
3. **Real Estate Data Analysis:** Predicting housing prices after scraping property listings.
4. **News Aggregation:** Building a dashboard of trending news topics using NLP.
